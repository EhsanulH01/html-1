      <h2 class="card-title">Fraud</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Monkey D. Dragon is supposed to be the most dangerous man in the world,
         but he hasn’t done anything to prove it. He leads the Revolutionary Army, but all the real
          work is done by other people like Sabo. Dragon just stands around, gives orders, and barely
           shows up. He talks big about fighting the World Government, but we’ve never seen him
            actually do anything. No big fights, no major wins, nothing. For someone with such a
             huge title, he’s all hype and no action. At this point, he looks like a total fraud.</p>

    <div class="right card"><img class="tile-image" src="./assets/images/Mihawk.png" alt="Dracule Mihawk">
      <h2 class="card-title">Strongest</h2>
      <p>Dracule Mihawk is the strongest in the One Piece world because he’s the greatest
         swordsman alive. He used to fight evenly with Shanks, a Yonko, and now trains Zoro,
          who’s one of the best fighters in the crew of the future Pirate King. Mihawk
           doesn’t even have a crew or a Devil Fruit—just pure skill. He carries a black
            blade, one of the strongest swords in the world, and beats enemies without breaking
             a sweat. No tricks, no powers—just unmatched swordsmanship. That’s why Mihawk is
              the strongest.</p>
